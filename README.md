iPhone App

Creating an iphone app that tracks your daily lifestyle status over different areas of your life including the following:
Diet, Fitness, Weight, Energy, Family, Business, Vices, Mood
Each category gets a status of happy, content or angry and the app sums up the total and creates a daily status emoji that shows what your overall well being is for the day.
The results of each day including all the category statuses will be saved to a different tab in the app in a calendar view. Each day on the caledar will show the well being status of the day. When you click on the status emoji for any given date, it will show you the status of each icon for that day.
